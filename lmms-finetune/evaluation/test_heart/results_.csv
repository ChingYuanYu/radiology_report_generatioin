The reference report states that the findings are within normal limits, which means there are no abnormal findings. The candidate report specifies that the heart size is within normal limits, which is a specific finding. However, since the reference report does not specify any particular finding, it is assumed that all findings are normal, including the heart size. Therefore, there are no errors in the candidate report.

The reference report states that the heart is normal, which is a general statement that does not provide specific details about the heart's condition. The candidate report, on the other hand, specifies that the heart size is within normal limits, which could be interpreted as a more detailed way of saying the heart is normal.

The candidate report is concise and matches the reference report in terms of clinical findings. There is no mention of the heart's size in the candidate report, which is equivalent to the reference report. However, the candidate report omits the word ""in"" between ""normal"" and ""size,"" which could potentially cause confusion, but this is not a clinically significant error.

The reference report states that the heart is unremarkable, which means there are no abnormalities found in the heart. The candidate report states that the cardiac contours appear normal, which is a different way of saying the same thing. Both reports essentially indicate that there are no abnormalities in the heart.

The reference report states that the heart is normal, while the candidate report states that the cardiac contours are within normal limits. The term ""cardiac contours"" refers to the outline of the heart, and while it is related to the heart, it is not the same as the heart itself.

The candidate report is more detailed than the reference report. It includes additional findings such as the appearance of the heart size and pulmonary vascularity, which are not mentioned in the reference report.

The candidate report is more detailed than the reference report. It includes additional findings such as the appearance of the heart size and pulmonary vascularity, which are not mentioned in the reference report. However, these additional findings do not contradict the reference report, and they do not seem to be clinically significant errors. The candidate report correctly matches the reference report in stating that the cardiac contours are within normal limits.

Heart size is within normal limits.,Cardiac contours are normal.,"
The candidate report does not mention the heart size, which is a significant finding in the reference report. Instead, it mentions the cardiac contours, which is a different aspect of the heart's anatomy. Therefore, the candidate report has missed a significant finding from the reference report.

[Clinically Significant Errors]:

[Matched Findings]:
1. Heart size unchanged.",0.5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1

The candidate report is generally in agreement with the reference report, but it uses a different term to describe the heart. The reference report mentions the heart size and pulmonary vascularity, while the candidate report refers to the heart's ""cardiac contours"". This could be considered a clinically insignificant error as it does not change the overall interpretation of the heart's condition.

The reference report only mentions ""Normal size"" which is a general statement about the size of an object. The candidate report, however, specifies the heart size as being within normal limits. This could be considered a false report of a finding as the reference report does not mention anything about the heart size.

The candidate report has missed two significant findings that were present in the reference report. The reference report mentions postop changes of CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting) and mild cardiomegaly (enlarged heart), both of which are not mentioned in the candidate report. The candidate report incorrectly states that the heart size is within normal limits.

The reference report states that the findings are within normal limits, which means there are no abnormal findings. The candidate report specifies that the cardiac contours are within normal limits, which is a specific finding. However, since the reference report does not specify this, it is assumed that the cardiac contours are normal. Therefore, there are no errors in the candidate report.

The candidate report is largely consistent with the reference report. Both reports indicate that the cardiomediastinal silhouette (or heart size and pulmonary vascularity in the candidate report) is within normal limits. However, the candidate report specifies the heart size and pulmonary vascularity, which is not mentioned in the reference report. This could be considered a clinically insignificant error as it does not change the overall interpretation of the findings.
