The candidate report is in agreement with the reference report.

"No consolidation, pneumothorax or large pleural effusion.",No focal airspace opacity. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.,"
The candidate report is largely consistent with the reference report. However, there is a minor discrepancy in the description of the findings. The reference report mentions ""No consolidation"", while the candidate report states ""No focal airspace opacity"". Although these terms can be used interchangeably in some contexts, they are not exactly the same. Consolidation refers to the accumulation of fluid in the lungs, while focal airspace opacity refers to any area in the lungs where the air is not visible. This could potentially be a clinically significant error, as it may imply a different finding.

The candidate report has several discrepancies when compared to the reference report. The candidate report falsely reports atherosclerotic calcifications in multiple lung airspace and minimal interstitial markings, which are not mentioned in the reference report. It also misses the findings of low lung volumes and left lung base atelectasis that are present in the reference report.

The candidate report mentions additional findings such as normal pulmonary vascularity, no focal airspace consolidation, and no pleural effusion or pneumothoraces, which are not present in the reference report. However, these additional findings do not contradict the reference report, and they do not represent clinically significant or insignificant errors.

The candidate report is largely consistent with the reference report.

(a) False report of a finding in the candidate: 1. Calcified left base calcified granuloma;
(b) Missing a finding present in the reference: 3. No pneumothorax; No large pleural effusions; No focal airspace opacities;
(c) Misidentification of a finding's anatomic location/position: 0.
(d) Misassessment of the severity of a finding: 0.
(e) Mentioning a comparison that isn't in the reference: 0.
(f) Omitting a comparison detailing a change from a prior study: 0.

[Clinically Insignificant Errors]:
(a) False report of a finding in the candidate: 0.
(b) Missing a finding present in the reference: 0.
(c) Misidentification of a finding's anatomic location/position: 0.
(d) Misassessment of the severity of a finding: 0.
(e) Mentioning a comparison that isn't in the reference: 0.
(f) Omitting a comparison detailing a change from a prior study: 0.

The candidate report is significantly less detailed than the reference report. While the candidate report states that the lungs are clear and expanded, it fails to mention the absence of focal areas of pulmonary consolidation, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion, which are all mentioned in the reference report.

[Clinically Significant Errors]:
(b) Missing a finding present in the reference: 3. No mention of absence of focal areas of pulmonary consolidation; No mention of absence of pneumothorax; No mention of absence of pleural effusion.

[Clinically Insignificant Errors]:
