Normal mediastinal contours.,Normal mediastinal silhouette.,"
The candidate report is essentially identical to the reference report, with the only difference being the use of the term ""silhouette"" instead of ""contours"". Both terms are used interchangeably in radiology to describe the outline of a structure, in this case, the mediastinum. Therefore, there are no errors in the candidate report.

The candidate report is not as specific as the reference report. The reference report specifically mentions that the mediastinal contours are within normal limits, while the candidate report only mentions that the cardiometaltotically is normal. This could be interpreted as a misidentification of the finding's anatomic location/position, as the candidate report does not specifically mention the mediastinal contours.

The candidate report mentions ""Unchanged mediastinal contours"" which implies a comparison to a previous study.

This discrepancy constitutes a clinically significant error as it could potentially lead to a misinterpretation of the patient's condition over time.

The candidate report is essentially the same as the reference report, but it omits the specific mention of the mediastinal contours being within normal limits. Instead, it vaguely states that the contour is normal.

The candidate report is largely consistent with the reference report, with one additional finding that is not present in the reference report. The candidate report mentions ""Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits"", which is not mentioned in the reference report. However, this does not constitute a clinically significant or insignificant error, as it does not contradict or misrepresent any findings in the reference report. It is simply an additional finding that is not present in the reference report.

Mediastinal contours are within normal limits for size and contour.,Number of pulmonary contours is unremarkable.,"
The candidate report incorrectly identifies the mediastinal contours as pulmonary contours. This is a clinically significant error as it misidentifies the anatomic location of the finding.

[Clinically Significant Errors]:
(c) Misidentification of a finding's anatomic location/position: 1. The candidate report identifies the mediastinal contours as pulmonary contours.
