The candidate report incorrectly states that the visualized osseous structures of the thorax are without acute abnormality.

Osseous structures are within normal limits for patient age.,"Mild bony patterns are present in the thoracic spine. Stable left clavicle,","
The candidate report mentions ""Mild bony patterns are present in the thoracic spine"" and ""Stable left clavicle"", which are not mentioned in the reference report. The reference report only mentions that the ""Osseous structures are within normal limits for patient age"". Therefore, the candidate report has falsely reported findings that are not present in the reference report.

The thoracic spine appears intact.,Osseous structures appear normal,"
The candidate report does not mention the thoracic spine, which is a significant omission as the reference report specifically mentions the thoracic spine. The candidate report instead mentions ""osseous structures"" in general, which is not specific enough and does not provide the same level of detail as the reference report.

[Clinically Significant Errors]:
(b) Missing a finding present in the reference: 1. The candidate report does not mention the thoracic spine.
