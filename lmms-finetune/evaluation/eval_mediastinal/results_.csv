Cardiomediastinal silhouette is grossly unremarkable.,Mediastinal contours are within normal limits.,"
The candidate report is essentially the same as the reference report, but uses slightly different terminology. The reference report mentions the ""Cardiomediastinal silhouette"" while the candidate report refers to the ""Mediastinal contours"". Both terms refer to the same anatomical region, so this is not a clinically significant error. However, the candidate report omits the word ""grossly"" which is used in the reference report to describe the unremarkable nature of the Cardiomediastinal silhouette. This could be considered a clinically insignificant error as it does not change the overall meaning of the finding.
